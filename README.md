**SCARA Robot Arm**  
*Arduino / C++ Implementation*

This project applies inverse kinematics and coordinated stepper motor control to move a SCARA arm's end effector to target positions with consistent precision.

---

**Features**

- Inverse kinematics to convert (x, y) coordinates into stepper motor steps
- Coordinated motor stepping with timing and direction control
- Basic electronic limiting to prevent overextension

---

**Tools Used**

- Arduino IDE (C++)
- Fritzing (for wiring diagrams and documentation)

---

**Planned Improvements**

*(Not actively under development)*

- Add homing routine using limit switches
- Implement forward kinematics to calculate end effector position
