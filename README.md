### SCARA Robot Firmware - ENGR113

This project applies inverse kinematics and coordinated stepper motor control to move a SCARA arm's end effector to target positions with consistent precision.

---

**Tools Used**

`Arduino IDE`
`Arduino`
`C++`
`Fritzing`

---

#### **Project Features**

- Inverse kinematics to convert (x, y) coordinates into stepper motor steps
- Coordinated motor stepping with timing and direction control
- Basic electronic limiting to prevent overextension

- ---

#### **Future Extensions**

> [!NOTE]
> This project is not currently under development.

- Add homing routine using limit switches
- Implement forward kinematics to calculate end effector position
